    "### Trajectory Simulator for Ball and Goal from the 2020 & 2021 FRC Seasons\n",
    "Interactive simulation for showing the ball trajectory launched toward the Inner & Outer Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Condition of the ball as launched is defined by 4 parameters:\n",
    "1) X0:    Horizontal distance [m] from the Outer Goal; Outer Goal is located at X=0,so X will be negative.\n",
    "2) Y0:    Verticle distance from the ground [m]\n",
    "3) Speed: Speed of the ball [m/s]\n",
    "4) Angle: Angle relative to the ground [deg]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### During flight, the ball is acted on by 2 forces:\n",
    "1) Gravity: Acts downward, with a constant value of g = 9.805 [m/s^2]\n",
    "2) Drag from air resistance:\n",
    "   a) Magnitude of the drag force is proportional to the speed squared\n",
    "   b) Direction of the drag force is opposite to the direction of travel\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The rectangles on the plot indicate the locations of the Outer and Inner goals.\n",
    "1) To go through the Inner Goal, the ball has to also go through the Outer Goal\n",
    "2) The height of the rectangles indicate the height of the opening, while the trajectory line shows where the center of the ball will travel, so if the line is close to the edge of the goal it may get deflected instead of going through.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interactive control\n",
    "The 4 sliders are for controlling the initial launch conditions.\n",
    "Various combinations can be tried to see:\n",
    "1) What conditions are viable\n",
    "2) What conditions are more robust\n",
    "    Example: What combnation of Speed & Angle will score a goal over a wider range of X0 values\n",
